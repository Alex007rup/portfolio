# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## The Nature of Light: A Duality

Light, that fascinating phenomenon that illuminates our world, has a complex and intriguing nature. It exhibits properties of both **waves and particles**, a concept known as **wave-particle duality**. 

**Light as a Wave:**

* **Diffraction and Interference:** Light waves can bend around obstacles and interfere with each other, creating patterns like those seen in a rainbow or through a prism. This behavior is characteristic of waves and is explained by the **wave theory of light**.
* **Electromagnetic Spectrum:** Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which exists as a continuous spectrum of wavelengths, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. 

**Light as a Particle:**

* **Photoelectric Effect:** When light interacts with certain materials, it can cause the ejection of electrons. This phenomenon, known as the photoelectric effect, suggests that light is made up of discrete packets of energy called **photons**.  
* **Compton Scattering:** The scattering of photons by electrons further supports the particle nature of light. 

**Reconciling the Duality:**

The wave and particle aspects of light are not contradictory but rather complementary. Light behaves like a wave under certain conditions and like a particle under others. The **quantum theory of light** provides a framework for understanding this duality, where light is described as a probability wave that determines the likelihood of finding a photon at a particular location.

**Understanding the nature of light has led to numerous technological advancements, including:**

* **Lasers:** Devices that emit highly concentrated and coherent beams of light.
* **Fiber optic communication:** Utilizing light pulses through thin fibers for high-speed data transmission.
* **Medical imaging:** Techniques like X-rays and MRIs rely on the properties of light to visualize the human body.

The study of light continues to be a fascinating and active area of research, with potential for further breakthroughs in various fields.
